\songtitle{Stupid}
\begin{verse*}
It's such a joy
The virus of love
What am I to do
Again chasing a boy
I see him come near
I 'm growing so tense
I know for sure now
He just thinks I'm dense
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
Oh, how do I fix this
It leads to no end
Where are you now when I need my best friend
It's driving me crazy
I need you right here
I am acting so stuuupid
Every time he comes near
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
I am at the gym
And play with the ball
When he passes by
I'm pretending to fall
He doesn't react
I feel such a fool
I know for sure now
He just thinks I'm dull
\end{verse*}

\thechorus

\begin{verse*}
And it happens every time
I can't ask: will you be mine
I act like a cow
So stupid somehow
I'll never be with him
I am forever alooooooone
\end{verse*}

\thechorus[2]

\begin{verse*}
So Stuuuupid
Every time he comes neaeaeaeaear
\end{verse*}
