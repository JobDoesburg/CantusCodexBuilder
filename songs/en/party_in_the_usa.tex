\songtitle{Party in the U.S.A.}
\begin{verse*}
I hopped off the plane at L.AX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (woah)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a Jay-Z song was on \repeatline{3}
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song
the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah
I got my hands up
they're playin' my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. \repeatline{2}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's looking at me now
Like, "Who's that chick, that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town"
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on \repeatline{3}
\end{verse*}

\thechorus

\begin{verse*}
Feel like hoppin' on a flight...
Back to my hometown tonight..
Something stops me every time...
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright...
\end{verse*}
