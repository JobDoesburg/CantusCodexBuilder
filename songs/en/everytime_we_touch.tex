\section{Everytime we touch}
I still hear your voice\\
when you sleep next to me\\
I still feel your touch in my dream\\
Forgive me my weakness\\
but I don't know why\\
Without you, it's hard to survive

\textbf{Refrein:}\\
'Cause every time we touch\\
I get this feeling\\
And every time we kiss\\
I swear I could fly\\
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?\\
I want this to last\\
I need you by my side

'Cause every time we touch\\
I feel the static\\
And every time we kiss\\
I reach for the sky\\
Can't you hear my heart beat so?\\
I can't let you go\\
I want you in my life

Your arms are my castle\\
Your heart is my sky\\
They wipe away tears that I cry.\\
The good and the bad times:\\
We've been through them all\\
You make me rise when I fall

\textbf{Refrein}

'Cause every time we touch\\
I get this feeling\\
And every time we kiss\\
I swear I could fly\\
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?\\
I want this to last\\
I need you by my side
