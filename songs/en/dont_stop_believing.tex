\songtitle{Don't stop believing}
\begin{verse*}
Just a small town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train going anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train going anywhere
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
A singer in a smokey room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin', somewhere in the night
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Some'll win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Whoa, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on
\end{verse*}

\thechorus

\begin{verse*}
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlights, people
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Don't stop believin'
Hold on
Streetlights, people
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlights, people
\end{verse*}
