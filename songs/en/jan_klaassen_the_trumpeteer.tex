\songtitle{Jan Klaassen The Trumpetteer}
\textbf{Chorus:}\\
Jan Klaassen played the trumpet in the army of the Prince\\
He was marching from Den Helder to Den Briel\\
He had no cash\\
Not a hero type\\
And he didn't like a clash or fight\\
But a trumpeter he was in heart and soul

The army pitched a camp of tents near Alkmaar in the fields\\
And there was no enemy in sight, so everyone felt brave\\
The pub became the headquarters as the most strategic place\\
The officers were shouting: "Jan, come play the trumpet now"\\
They woke up in the gutter dirt, the next morning, freezing cold\\
But Jan Klaassen slept in the warm arms of the daughter of the judge 

\textbf{Chorus}

The Prince, on an inspection, said to the Field Officer First Class\\
"I have seen all the pieces here of my artillery\\
Yes, even saw your collar-piece and the blond one in your bed\\
But where's that piece of misery, our trumpet player Jan"

No one could find Jan Klaassen, sitting at the city gate\\
And playing songs for hours for the children of the town 

\textbf{Chorus}

Jan Klaassen said: "Farewell my love, I will see you next year\\
As soon as spring returns, I'm sure that we will meet again"\\
The winter passed, the summer came, the war was over now\\
But the army never did return from the heatherlands\\
They never found back something of Jan Klaassen till this day\\
But all the children know his name, he is not dead, he lives 

\textbf{Chorus}

He had no cash\\
Not a hero type\\
And he didn't like a clash or fight\\
But a trumpeter he was in heart and soul
