\songtitle{You'll Never Walk Alone}
\begin{verse*}
When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
At the end of a storm
There's a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Walk on, through the wind
Walk on, through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
You'll never walk alone
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
You'll never walk alone
\end{verse*}
