\section{Sweet Caroline}
Where it began, I can't begin to knowing\\
But then I know it's growing strong\\
Was in the spring\\
Then spring became the summer\\\
Who'd have believed you'd come along

Hands, touching hands\\
Reaching out, touching me, touching you

Sweet Caroline\\
Good times never seemed so good (so good, so good, so good)\\
I'd be inclined\\
To believe they never would\\
But now I...

...look at the night and it don't seem so lonely\\
We filled it up with only two\\
And when I hurt\\
Hurting runs off my shoulders\\
How can I hurt when I'm holding you\\

One, touching one\\
Reaching out, touching me, touching you

Sweet Caroline\\
Good times never seemed so good\\
I'd be inclined\\
To believe they never would\\
Oh no, no

Sweet Caroline\\
Good times never seemed so good\\
Sweet Caroline\\
I believe they never could
