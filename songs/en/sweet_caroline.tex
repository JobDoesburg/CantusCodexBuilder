\songtitle{Sweet Caroline}
\begin{verse*}
Where it began, I can't begin to knowing
But then I know it's growing strong
Was in the spring
Then spring became the summer\
Who'd have believed you'd come along
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Hands, touching hands
Reaching out, touching me, touching you
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good (so good, so good, so good)
I'd be inclined
To believe they never would
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
But now I...
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
...look at the night and it don't seem so lonely
We filled it up with only two
And when I hurt
Hurting runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when I'm holding you
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
One, touching one
Reaching out, touching me, touching you
\end{verse*}
