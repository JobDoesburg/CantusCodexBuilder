\songtitle{Summer Paradise}
\begin{verse*}
My heart is sinking as I'm lifting
Up above the clouds away from you
And I can't believe I'm leaving
Oh, I don't know, know, know what I'm gonna do
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
But someday, I will find my way back
To where your name is written in the sand
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
'Cause I remember every sunset
I remember every word you said
And we were never gonna say goodbye
Singing la-da-da-da-da
Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you
And I'll be there in a heartbeat, oh-oh
I'll be there in a heartbeat, oh-oh
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
My soul is broken, the streets are frozen
I can't stop these feelings melting through
And I'd give away a thousand days
Oh, just to have another one with you
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Where real life can wait
We're crashing like waves
We're playing in the sand
Holding your hand
\end{verse*}

\thechorus

\begin{verse*}
Someday, I will find my way back
To where your name is written in the sand
\end{verse*}

\thechorus

\begin{verse*}
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
\end{verse*}
