\begin{verse*}
Oh, thinkin' about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Now, nothin' can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven...
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven...
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Oh, once in your life you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you're feelin' down
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Yeah, nothin' could change what you mean to me
Oh, there's lots that I could say
But just hold me now
'Cause our love will light the way
\end{verse*}

\thechorus

\begin{bridge*}
I've been waitin' for so long
For somethin' to arrive
For love to come along\\
Now our dreams are comin' true
Through the good times and the bad
Yeah, I'll be standin' there by you
\end{bridge*}
