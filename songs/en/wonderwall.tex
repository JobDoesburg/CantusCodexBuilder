\songtitle{Wonderwall}
\begin{verse*}
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do, about you now
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Backbeat, the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I
Would like to say to you but I don't know how
Because maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all, you're my wonderwall
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
And after all, you're my wonderwall
I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me \textbf{(2x)}
