\section{Wonderwall}
Today is gonna be the day\\
That they're gonna throw it back to you\\
By now you should've somehow\\
Realized what you gotta do\\
I don't believe that anybody\\
Feels the way I do, about you now

Backbeat, the word was on the street\\
That the fire in your heart is out\\
I'm sure you've heard it all before\\
But you never really had a doubt\\
I don't believe that anybody\\
Feels the way I do about you now

\textbf{Refrein:}\\
And all the roads we have to walk are winding\\
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding\\
There are many things that I\\
Would like to say to you but I don't know how\\
Because maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me\\
And after all, you're my wonderwall

\textbf{Refrein}

And after all, you're my wonderwall\\
I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me\\
