\songtitle{Eye of the Tiger}
\begin{verse*}
Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
So many times it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip 
on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye
of the tiger...
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds
still we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive
\end{verse*}

\thechorus

\begin{verse*}
Rising up, straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive
\end{verse*}
