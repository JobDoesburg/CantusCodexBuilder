\songtitle{We Will Rock You}
\begin{verse*}
Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace 
Kicking your can all over the place, singin'
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
We will, we will rock you
Sing it!
We will, we will rock you
Yeah
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes, gonna get you some peace someday
You got mud on your face, big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place, do it!
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
We will, we will rock you
Yeah, yeah, come on
We will, we will rock you
Alright, louder!
We will, we will rock you
One more time
We will, we will rock you
Yeah
\end{verse*}
