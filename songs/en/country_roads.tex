\section{Country roads}
Almost heaven, West Virginia \\
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River\\
Life is old there, older than the trees\\
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze

\textbf{Refrein:}\\
Country roads, take me home\\
To the place I belong\\
West Virginia, mountain mama\\
Take me home, country roads

All my memories gather round her\\
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water\\
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky\\
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

\textbf{Refrein}

I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me\\
The radio reminds me of my home far away\\
And driving down the road I get a feeling that I\\
should have been home yesterday\\
yesterday

\textbf{Refrein (2x)}

Lalala heyhey lalala heyhey lalala heyhey lalala\\
West Virginia, Mounty Mamma\\
Take me home, country roads\\
Lalala heyhey lalala heyhey lalala heyhey lalala\\
West Virginia, Mounty Mamma\\
Take me home, country roads\\

Take me home, down country roads\\
Take me home, down country roads
