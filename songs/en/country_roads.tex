\songtitle{Country Roads}
\begin{verse*}
Almost heaven, West Virginia 
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
All my memories gather round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
\end{verse*}

\thechorus

\begin{bridge*}
I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
And driving down the road I get a feeling that I
should have been home yesterday
yesterday
\end{bridge*}

\thechorus[2]

\begin{verse*}
Lalala heyhey lalala heyhey lalala heyhey lalala
West Virginia, Mounty Mamma
Take me home, country roads
Lalala heyhey lalala heyhey lalala heyhey lalala
West Virginia, Mounty Mamma
Take me home, country roads
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Take me home, down country roads \repeatline{2}
\end{verse*}
