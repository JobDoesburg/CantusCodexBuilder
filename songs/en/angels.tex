\songtitle{Angels}
\begin{verse*}
I sit and wait
Does an angel contemplate my fate
And do they know
The places where we go
When we're grey and old
'Cause I have been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
So when I'm lying in my bed
Thoughts running through my head
And I feel the love is dead
I'm loving angels instead
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call, she won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm loving angels instead
\end{verse*}
