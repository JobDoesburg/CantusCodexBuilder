\songtitle{Best Day of My Life}
  \begin{samepage}
\begin{verse*}
I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high I touched the clouds
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh
wo-o-o-o-o-oh
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh
wo-o-o-o-o-oh
\end{verse*}

\begin{bridge*}
I'm never gonna look back, whoa
I'm never gonna give it up, no
Please don't wake me now
\textit{(two, three, four)}
\end{bridge*}

\begin{chorus}
Oeeh-oeeh-oeh
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
\end{chorus}

\thechorus

\begin{verse*}
I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh
wo-o-o-o-o-oh
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
But all the possibilities
No limits, just epiphanies
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh
wo-o-o-o-o-oh
\end{verse*}

\begin{bridge*}
I'm never gonna look back, whoa
I'm never gonna give it up, no
Just don't wake me now
\end{bridge*}

\thechorus[2]

\begin{bridge*}
I hear it calling
outside my window
I feel it in my soul... (my soul...)
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control... (control...)
\end{bridge*}

\thechorus[2]

\begin{bridge*}
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be
The best day of my life
Everything is looking up, everybody up now
\end{bridge*}
