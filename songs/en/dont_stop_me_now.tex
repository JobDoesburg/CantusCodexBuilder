\songtitle{Don't Stop Me Now}
\begin{verse*}
Tonight
I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
So don't stop me now don't stop me
'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
I'm a shooting star, leaping through the sky
Like a tiger, defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car, passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go
There's no stopping me
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
Don't stop me now, I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
Don't stop me now \textit{('cause I'm having a good time)}
Don't stop me now \textit{(yes, I'm havin' a good time)}
I don't want to stop at all
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
Yeah, I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I am a sex machine, ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh explode
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Don't stop me, hey, hey, hey
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Ooh ooh ooh \textit{(I like it)}
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Have a good time, good time
Don't stop me, don't stop me \textit{(ahhhh)}
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Oh, I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you
\end{verse*}
