\section{Breaking free}
We're soaring, flying, there's not a star in\\
heaven that we can’t reach\\
If we're trying, so we're breaking free

You know the world can see us\\
in a way that different than who we are\\
Creating space between us\\
till we're seperate hearts\\
But your faith it gives me strength\\
strength to believe\\
We're breaking free

\textbf{Refrein}\\
We're soaring, flying
there's not a star in\\
heaven that we can’t reach\\
If we're trying,\\
yeah we're breaking free.\\
Ooh, we're breaking free!

Can you feel it building\\
like a wave the ocean just can’t control\\
Connected by your feeling\\
ooh in the very soul\\
Rising till it lifts us up\\
so everyone can see\\
We're breaking free

\textbf{Refrein}

Running, climbing, to get to the place\\
to be all that we can be\\
Nows the time\\
so we're breaking free,\\
we're breaking free

More than hope, more than faith\\
this is true, this is fate\\
And together we see it coming\\
more than you, more than me\\
Not a want, but a need,\\
both of us, breaking free!

\textbf{Refrein:}\\
We're running, climbing, to get to that place\\
and be all that we can be\\
Nows the time,\\
so we're breaking free,\\
ooh we're breaking free

You know the world can see us\\
in a way that's different than who we are
