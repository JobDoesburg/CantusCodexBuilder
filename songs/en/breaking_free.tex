\section{Breaking Free}
We're soaring, flying\\
There's not a star in heaven that we can’t reach

If we're trying\\
so we're breaking free

You know the world can see us\\
in a way that's different than who we are

Creating space between us\\
'Til we're separate hearts

But your faith it gives me strength,\\
strength to believe

We're breaking free!

\textbf{Refrein:}\\
We're soarin'\\
Flyin'\\
there's not a star in heaven that we can’t reach\\
If we're trying,\\
yeah we're breaking free.\\
Ooh, we're breaking free!

Can you feel it building\\
like a wave the ocean just can’t control\\
Connected by your feeling\\
Ohhh, in our very souls \textit{(Very souls, ohhh)}\\
Rising 'til it lifts us up\\
So everyone can see

We're breaking free!

\textbf{Refrein 2:}

Running, climbing\\
To get to the place to be all that we can be\\
Nows the time\\
so we're breaking free\\
we're breaking free

More than hope, more than faith\\
this is true, this is fate\\
And together we see it coming\\
more than you, more than me\\
Not a want, but a need,\\
both of us, breaking free!

\textbf{Refrein}

\textbf{Refrein 2}

You know the world can see us\\
in a way that's different than who we are
