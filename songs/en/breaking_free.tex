\songtitle{Breaking Free}
\begin{verse*}
We're soaring, flying
There's not a star in heaven that we can’t reach
If we're trying
so we're breaking free
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
You know the world can see us
in a way that's different than who we are
Creating space between us
'Til we're separate hearts
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
But your faith it gives me strength,
strength to believe
We're breaking free!
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
We're soarin'
Flyin'
there's not a star in heaven that we can’t reach
If we're trying,
yeah we're breaking free.
Ooh, we're breaking free!
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
Can you feel it building
like a wave the ocean just can’t control
Connected by your feeling
Ohhh, in our very souls \textit{(Very souls, ohhh)}
Rising 'til it lifts us up
So everyone can see
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
We're breaking free!
\end{verse*}

\thechorus

\begin{verse*}
Running, climbing
To get to the place to be all that we can be
Now's the time
so we're breaking free
we're breaking free
\end{verse*}

\begin{bridge}
More than hope, more than faith
this is true, this is fate
And together we see it coming
more than you, more than me
Not a want, but a need,
both of us, breaking free!
\end{bridge}

\thechorus

\begin{verse*}
Running, climbing
To get to the place to be all that we can be
Now's the time
so we're breaking free
we're breaking free
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
You know the world can see us
in a way that's different than who we are
\end{verse*}
