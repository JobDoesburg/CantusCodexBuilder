\section{Walking down Canal street}
\textbf{Heren:}\\
Walking down Canal street\\
Knocking on every door\\
Goddamn son of a bitch\\
I couldn't find a whore

I finally found a whore\\
She was tall and thin\\
Goddamn son of a bitch\\
I couldn't get it in

I finally got it in\\
Worked it round and round\\
Goddamn son of a bitch\\
I couldn't get it out

I finally got it out\\
It was wet and sore\\
The moral of this story is\\
To never fuck a whore

\textit{Six weeks later\\
I went for a piss\\
Goddamn son of a bitch\\
She gave me syphilis!

Nine months later\\
I'd forgotten what I did\\
Goddamn son of a bitch\\
She brought me home a kid!\\
}

\textbf{Dames:}\\
Walking down Canal street\\
Feeling rather high\\
Goddamn son of a bitch\\
I couldn’t find a guy

I finally found a guy\\ 
Ment to do it quick\\
God damn son of a bitch\\
I couldn’t find his dick

I finally found his dick\\
Had to give it a rub\\
God damn son of a bitch\\
He couldn’t get it up

He finally got it up\\
Feeling rather hot\\
God damn son of a bitch\\
He couldn’t find the spot

He finally found the spot\\
Then he spilled his stuff:\\
Girls remember this:\\
Guys can only bluff
