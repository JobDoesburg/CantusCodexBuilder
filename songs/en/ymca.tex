\begin{verse*}
Young man
there's no need to feel down
I said, young man
pick yourself off the ground
I said, young man
'cause you're in a new town
There's no need to be unhappy
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Young man
there's a place you can go
I said, young man
when you're short on your dough
You can stay there
and I'm sure you will find
Many ways to have a good time
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A. \repeatline{2}

\begin{verse*}
They have everything for young men to enjoy,
You can hang out with all the boys...
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
You can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal,
You can do whatever you feel...
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Young man
are you listening to me?
I said, young man
what do you wanna be?
I said, young man
you can make real your dreams
But you got to know this one thing!
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
No man
does it all by himself
I said, young man
put your pride on the shelf
And just go there
to the Y.M.C.A.
I'm sure they can help you today

\begin{verse*}
Young man
I was once in your shoes
I said, I was
down and out with the blues
I felt no man
cared if I were alive
I felt the whole world was so jive...
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
That's when
someone came up to me,
And said, "Young man,
take a walk up the street
There's a place there
called the 'Y.M.C.A.'
They can start you back on your way."
