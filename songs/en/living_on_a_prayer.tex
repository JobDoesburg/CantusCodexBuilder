\songtitle{Living on a prayer}
\begin{verse*}
Tommy used to work on the docks
union's been on strike
He's down on his luck
it's tough
so tough
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Gina works the diner all day
working for her man
She brings home her pay
for love
for love
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holding in
what he used to make it talk
So tough
it's tough
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night,
Tommy whispers
Baby, it's okay,
someday
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Livin' on a prayer
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Oh, we've got to hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Livin' on a prayer
\end{verse*}
