\songtitle{I Want It That Way}
\begin{verse*}
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
But we are two worlds apart
Can’t reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
Tell me why
Ain’t nothin’ but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain’t nothin’ but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
Am I your fire
Your one desire
Yes I know it’s too late
But I want it that way
\end{verse*}

\thechorus

\begin{verse*}
Now I can see that we’re falling apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me...
You are my fire
The one desire
You are \textbf{(4x)}
Don’t wanna hear you say
\end{verse*}

\thechorus

\begin{verse*}
’Cause I want it that way
\end{verse*}
