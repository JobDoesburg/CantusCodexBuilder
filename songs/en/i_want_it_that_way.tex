\section{I want it that way}
You are my fire\\
The one desire\\
Believe when I say\\
I want it that way

But we are two worlds apart\\
Can’t reach to your heart\\
When you say\\
That I want it that way

\textbf{Refrein:}\\
Tell me why\\
Ain’t nothin’ but a heartache\\
Tell me why\\
Ain’t nothin’ but a mistake\\
Tell me why\\
I never wanna hear you say\\
I want it that way

Am I your fire\\
Your one desire\\
Yes I know it’s too late\\
But I want it that way

\textbf{Refrein}

Now I can see that we’re falling apart\\
From the way that it used to be, yeah\\
No matter the distance\\
I want you to know\\
That deep down inside of me...\\
You are my fire\\
The one desire\\
You are \textbf{(4x)}\\
Don’t wanna hear you say

\textbf{Refrein (2x)}

’Cause I want it that way
