\section{Hangover}
\textbf{Refrein:}\\
I got a hangover, wo-oh!\\
I've been drinking too much for sure\\
I got a hangover, wo-oh!\\
I got an empty cup, pour me some more

So I can go until I blow up, eh\\
And I can drink until I throw up, eh\\
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh\\
I wanna keep it going, keep, keep it going, going, going, going!

I got a little bit trashed last night, \textit{night}\\
I got a little bit wasted, \textit{yeah yeah}\\
I got a little bit mashed last night, \textit{night}\\
I got a little shit faceted, \textit{yeah yeah (well)}\\
Oh oh oh oh oh\\
I'm on the roof\\
If you don't know\\
Well now you know

\textbf{Refrein}

Drink up 'cause a party ain't a party 'til you ride out through it\\
End up on the floor but can't remember, you clueless\\
Officer like what the hell is you doing?\\
Stumbling, fumbling, you wanna what? Come again\\
Give me Henn, give me gin, give me liquor, give me champagne bubbles 'til I'm bent\\
What happens after that? If you inspired then tell a friend\\
Like oh my homie Taio, we can all sip again\\
Get it in and again and again, leave evidence\\
Wasted, so what? Irrelevant\\
Beer keg to the head, who's selling it\\
I got a hangover, that's my medicine\\
Don't mean to brag or sound too intelligent\\
A little Jack can't hurt this veteran\\
I show up but I never throw up\\
So let the drinks pour up, pour up
