\songtitle{Piano Man}
\begin{verse*}
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Making love to his tonic and gin
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
He says, "Son can you play me a memory
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet
And I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes."
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
La, la-la, di-di-da
La-la di-di-da da-dum
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
Sing us a song you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."
As a smile ran away from his face
"Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place."
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes they're sharing a drink they call "Loneliness"
But it's better than drinking alone
\end{verse*}

\thechorus

\begin{verse*}
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
To forget about life for a while
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
And the piano it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, "Man, what are you doing here?"
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
La, la-la, di-di-da
La-la di-di-da da-dum
\end{verse*}
