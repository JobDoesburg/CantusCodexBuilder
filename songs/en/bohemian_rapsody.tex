\songtitle{Bohemian Rhapsody}
\begin{verse*}
Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Any way the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me..., to me
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Mamaaa
Just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mamaaa
Life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mamaaa, oooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Too late
My time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody
I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mamaaa, oooh
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch, will you do the fandango
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Thunderbolt and lightning
very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnificoo
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
\textit{(Let him go!)} Bismillah! We will not let you go
\textit{(Let him go!)} Bismillah! We will not let you go
\textit{(Let me go)} Will not let you go
\textit{(Let me go)} \textit{(Never)} Never let you go
\textit{(Let me go)} \textit{(Never)} let you go \textit{(Let me go)} Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,
For meee
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby
Can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
nothing really matters to me
Anyway the wind blows...
\end{verse*}
