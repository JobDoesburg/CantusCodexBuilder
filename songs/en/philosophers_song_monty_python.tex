\section{Bruces' philosophers song}
Immanuel Kant\\
was a real piss-ant\\
who was very rarely stable.\\
Heidegger, Heidegger\\
was a boozy beggar\\
who could think you under the table.\\
David Hume\\
could out-consume\\
Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.\\
And Wittgenstein\\
was a beery swine\\
who was just as sloshed as Schlegel.

There's nothing Nietzsche\\
couldn't teach 'ya\\
'bout the raising of the wrist...\\
Socrates, himself,\\
was permanently pissed...

John Stuart Mill,\\
of his own free will,\\
after half a pint of shandy was particularly ill.\\
Plato, they say,\\
could stick it away,\\
'alf a crate of whiskey every day!\\
Aristotle, Aristotle,\\
was a bugger for the bottle,\\
And Hobbes was fond of his Dram.\\
And Rene Descartes\\
was a drunken fart:\\
I drink, therefore I am.

Yes, Socrates himself\\
is particularly missed...\\
A lovely little thinker,\\
but a bugger when he's pissed...
