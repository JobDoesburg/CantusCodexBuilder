\songtitle{Let It Be}
\begin{verse*}
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
And when the broken-hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
For though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
\end{verse*}

\thechorus[2]

\begin{verse*}
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
\end{verse*}
