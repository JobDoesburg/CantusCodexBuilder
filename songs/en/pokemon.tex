\section{Pokemon Theme Song}

I wanna be the very best, like no one ever was\\
To catch them is my real test\\
to train them is my cause\\
I will travel across the land, searching far and wide\\
Teach Pokémon to understand\\
the power that's inside 

Pokémon\\
Gotta catch em all (It's you and me)\\
I know it's my destiny, Pokémon\\
Oh, you're my best friend\\
In a world we must defend

Pokémon\\
Gotta catch 'em all (A heart so trueeee)\\
Our courage will pull us through\\
You teach me\\
And I teach you

Pokémon\\
Gotta catch 'em all, gotta catch 'em all\\
Pokémon

Every challenge along the way\\
With courage I will face\\
I will battle everyday\\
To claim my right full place\\
Come with me, the time is right\\
Theres no better team\\
Arm and arm we`ll win the fight\\
Its always been our dream
