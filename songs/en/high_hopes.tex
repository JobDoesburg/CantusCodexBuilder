\songtitle{High Hopes}
\begin{chorus}
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
Mama said
Fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater
Go make a legacy
Manifest destiny
Back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Mama said
Burn your biographies
Rewrite your history
Light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, everyday
We wanted everything, wanted everything
\end{verse*}

\begin{prechorus}
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
\end{prechorus}

\begin{verse*}
Mama said
It's uphill for oddities
Stranger crusaders
Ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties
Don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything
\end{verse*}

\begin{bridge}
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down
\end{bridge}
