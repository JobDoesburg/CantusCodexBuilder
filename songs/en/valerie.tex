\begin{bridge}
Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things,
what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture
\end{bridge}

\begin{chorus}
Since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie \repeatline{3}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
Did you have to go to jail,
Put your house on up for sale,
did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan,
I hope you find the right man,
who'll fix it for ya
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Are you shopping anywhere,
Changed the color of your hair,
are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
That you were dodging all the time,
are you still dizzy?
\end{verse*}
