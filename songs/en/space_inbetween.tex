\songtitle{The Space In Between}
Can't figure out how we got here\\
Living on decay\\
The seven words left on paper\\
Will disconnect the day

And you want... \textbf{(3x)}\\
anything that's clear

\textbf{Refrein:}\\
And it's all around us\\
As ghosted machines\\
Would the real be just silent\\
If there's a hole in the key?\\
At the bar in the basement\\
For an hour-glass of tea\\
Our love is violent\\
Space in between

And the taste has got a texture\\
Smoke has not a sound\\
The fabric that was fixed here\\
Inherent in the ground

\textbf{Refrein}

And as much as I'd like to\\
Believe there's a truth\\
About our illusion, well...\\
I've come to conclude\\
There's just nothing beyond it\\
The mind can perceive\\
Except for the pictures in\\
The space in between\\
The space in between
