\songtitle{Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!}
\begin{verse*}
Half-past twelve
And I'm watching the late show
in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window
as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow
with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
Tired of TV
I open the window
and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
\end{verse*}

\begin{verse*}
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
\end{verse*}
