\begin{verse*}
When I dance they call me Macarena
And the boys they say que estoy buena
They all want me
they can't have me
So they all come and dance beside me
Move with me
chant with me
And if you're good I'll take you home with me
\end{verse*}

\begin{chorus}
Dale a tu cuerpo alegria Macarena
Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle alegria cosa buena
Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena
Hey Macarena!
(Ay!)
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse*}
Now don't you worry about my boyfriend
The boy whose name is Vitorino
Ha! I don't want him, can't stand him
He was no good so I, ha ha ha
\end{verse*}

\begin{bridge*}
Now come on, what was I supposed to do?
He was out of town and his two friends were so fine
\end{bridge*}
