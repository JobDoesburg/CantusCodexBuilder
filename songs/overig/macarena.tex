\section{Macarena}
When I dance they call me Macarena\\
And the boys they say que estoy buena\\
They all want me\\
they can't have me\\
So they all come and dance beside me\\
Move with me\\
chant with me\\
And if you're good I'll take you home with me

\textbf{Refrein:}\\
Dale a tu cuerpo alegria Macarena\\
Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle alegria cosa buena\\
Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena\\
Hey Macarena!\\
(Ay!)

\textbf{Refrein}

Now don't you worry about my boyfriend\\
The boy whose name is Vitorino\\
Ha! I don't want him, can't stand him\\
He was no good so I, ha ha ha

Now come on, what was I supposed to do?\\
He was out of town and his two friends were so fine

\textbf{Refrein (2x)}
