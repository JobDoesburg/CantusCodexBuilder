# Cantus Codex Builder
Anyone who ever organized a [cantus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantus), knows that building a Codex always takes a lot of time. Most of the time, you just recycle an old codex from an earlier Cantus and just settle with the fact that not all songs are in there. Or you spend hours and hours searching for lyrics, only to find shamefull mistakes after printing. 

Not anymore! This repository functions as an archive for most popular cantus songs, in order to make it incredibly easy to build the perfect Codex in minutes.

## How to make a codex

It is very easy to build your own Codex. Simply edit `main.tex` to set a title and image for the Codex, and include the preferred songs using `\input{}` statements. 

Naturally, you can make further changes, for example in the `regularum.tex` file(s). Also, you can make changes to or include your own songs. With sufficient knowledge of LaTeX, this should not be too hard.

Note that [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) supports opening projects directly from GitHub, which works like a charm!

## Contributing
Just as a proper Cantus relies on the community, this repository also heavily relies on the community's contributions! We strongly invite you to add all popular (or unpopular) cantus songs to this repository in a proper way. Please create a PR when you want to add a song and it will gladly be merged, so for the future, other people can use it too. 

Also if you happen to find any typos or other errors in lyrics, please fix them and create a PR!

If there are lyrics missing, you can also create an issue. 

## Intelectual property
I do not posses any form of intelectual property on the songs from which the lyrics are included in this repository (with some exceptions). Many songs will have expired copyright and or be in the public domain. For the songs that are under copyright, we appeal to Fair Use of the material. 

We try to credit the authors of all lyrics.
